# Shopify Internship Challenge
## About
A tech challenge for the front-end shopify internship

## Tech Stack
- Using styled components because I like the readability and like my CSS in JS
- Using React for frontend framework for handling changing data from axios calls seamlessly 
- Using axios for API calls for better cross browser compatibility  and JSON res

## Demo

## Things I would want to add 
- Fix UI - some design changes that impact UX (different colours for error and success toasts/notifications)
- ~~Add carousel to nominations for better UX instead of just making them smaller, doesnt look good when cards just get squished~~
